# Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict loan approvals based on applicant data. The process involves data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Features

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gathering historical loan data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing data distributions, identifying patterns, and visualizing relationships between variables.

- **Model Selection and Training**: Implementing algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and XGBoost to build predictive models.

- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to enhance predictive performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

# Loan Approval Prediction Dataset Handling

This project uses a dataset containing information about loan applicants to predict loan approval. The dataset is prepared and processed to ensure high-quality predictions using machine learning models.

## Dataset Details

The dataset consists of the following types of information:

### Columns
1. **Applicant Details**:
   - `Gender`: Male/Female.
   - `Married`: Applicant's marital status.
   - `Dependents`: Number of dependents the applicant has.
   - `Education`: Graduate/Not Graduate.
   - `Self_Employed`: Whether the applicant is self-employed.

2. **Financial Information**:
   - `ApplicantIncome`: Income of the applicant.
   - `CoapplicantIncome`: Income of the co-applicant (if any).
   - `LoanAmount`: Requested loan amount.
   - `Loan_Amount_Term`: Loan repayment term in months.
   - `Credit_History`: Credit history score (1.0 for good, 0.0 for bad).

3. **Loan Details**:
   - `Property_Area`: Location of the property (Urban/Rural/Semiurban).
   - `Loan_Status`: Target variable indicating loan approval (Y/N).
